          Situated in the Kullu Valley of Himachal Pradesh, Manali draws tourists with its natural beauty and tranquillity. The hill station is frequented by travellers from across the country, especially during the summer season when cities reel under the scorching heat. Snow-capped mountains, dense forests, riverine valleys and sparkling streams add to the beauty of the hill station and make it one of the most popular holiday destinations in India. Another charming thing about Manali is that it showcases a beautiful blend of rich cultural heritage and modernisation. Besides spending time in serenity and soaking in the beauty of the surroundings, you can engage in thrilling adventure activities here for a memorable vacation.

            Known for pleasant weather conditions and picturesque locations, Shillong in Meghalaya is one of the most cliched yet highly frequented tourist destinations in India. The hill station is popularly known as Scotland of the East, thanks to the rolling hills, gushing waterfalls and lovely landscape that reminded European colonists of stunning Scotland. Shillong also boasts crystal-clear lakes, high mountain peaks and amazing golf courses, museums and cafes. What’s more, the distinct culture, delectable local cuisines and amazing shopping hubs promise a fun-filled vacation every time.

            Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the
            1050A to California and El Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total
            from the Gates Computer Science Building!)

            I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only
            because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not
            even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I
            do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

            Ladakh, the capital of Leh, is in the eastern parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh is known for its pristine lakes, freezing winds, glaciers and sand dunes. It has kept its distance from the modern world – and thank heavens for that.
            The most famous tourist attractions here are Pangong Lake, Tso Moriri lake and Leh Palace. There’s also many adventures to be found here, from white water rafting to mountaineering and trekking.
